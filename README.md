# This repository is my practice of Digital Circuit and VHDL.

Basic components such as 3-8 decoder, logic doors are implemented.
All the files are made with VHDL, which is very easy to read.
If you are learning Digital Circuit and having difficulties understanding the principles of the complex components, I hope this repository would help.

However, only the components are implemented, and there is no test code. So please don't just copy the code into your projects, for some bugs may be contained. Nevertheless, you can regard my code as a reference, and come up with yours on your own.
